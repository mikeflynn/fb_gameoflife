I don't have the official instructions, but essentially this is a modified version of the "Game of Life" algorithm.

Essentially there is a grid of black and white boxes. For each iteration, every box should be checked for it's neighbors (the 3x3 grid that surounds the box). If it has more black neighbors than white, the box becomes black, if it has more white than black neighbors, it becomes white. All changes take place after the itteration's complete, and the boxes on the edge of the grid won't change color.

Notes:
- The script takes specifically formatted input via STDIN.
- The input file's first line says how many boards are in this run, and then each board input starts with an input line consisting of the number of boxes in a row (n) followed by the number of itterations that should be run. Following that, there are n rows of w/b strings specifying the starting state of the grid.
- Sample inputs and outputs are in the test directory.
